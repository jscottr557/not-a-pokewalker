Not a pokewalker project

Goal: Reproduce the functionality of a pokewalker without splitting hairs

Top level feature domains include:
Logic
Graphics
Sound
Comms
EPROM
The literal hardware configuration of the device

If I were a better software engineer then this project wouldn't be organized like a bowl of spaghetti.
Start in logic/driving_loop.cpp and follow the calls down the rabbit hole.
